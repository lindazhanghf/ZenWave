# ZenWave
This project was done for my internship at Moxie as a Future Experience Intern.

I used the Muse Headband to develop an experience that showcases the potential of Brain-Computer Interface.

This demo guides users through a series of actions to control the visuals on the wall through their brainwaves. Then they meditate for one minute using the visuals and audio cues. The visualization of their brainwave during the meditation will be shown on the TV.
